# LAB ACTIVITY 5: HTML, CSS and DOM
## Software Systems Development

### Question 1
Made an index.html which has a div which encloses two input fields for username and password with a submit button. The button redirects the user to another html page using form action. 

On the next page studentRecords.html, added two input fields for roll no and name and followed by an add row button. The add row button has an onclick function which first identifies the table via id, adds a row with two cells and then populates the cells using the values of the two fields rollno and name.

The first row is a separate table which has the heading as to avoid deleting it when delete row operation is performed on an empty table. Next the main table is defined which is initially empty but adds rows when "addrow" functionality is used.

The table is followed by a delete button which has an onclick function and deletes the last added row.

### Question 2
Made a separate css stylesheet called style.css and mentioned all the required functionalities mentioned in the same and then added in the html files using link.
